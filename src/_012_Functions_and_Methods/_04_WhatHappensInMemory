Stack -- Ladder -- ek ke upar ek

Stack Memory (used for method execution):
Each time a method is invoked, a new stack frame is created in the stack memory.

A stack frame contains:-
Method's local variables.
References to objects in the heap (if needed).
A return address (to know where to go back after the method finishes).
The stack frame is used only for that particular method call.
When the method execution completes, the stack frame is removed (popped) from the stack, and the memory is freed.
